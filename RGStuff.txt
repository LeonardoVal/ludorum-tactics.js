Heuristic : 

Hp in combat is given by
defender.hp -= attacker.hp * attacker.hitChance * (1 - defender.saveChance);
hp<0.5 = death


I should try to kill pieces 
Each state is given by :
-Movement. 
+Atacks made and won.
-Being in atackrange
-Line of sight reduced
-Line of sight reduced to my piece positions
-Atacks negated by my own pieces.

I should try to : 
Cluster my pieces with out loosing atack posiblitty


-----------Atacks-----------
I should try to maximize this value. this valueis given by HP in combat.
The atacks should put myself in a position where:

--POSIBLE DAMAGE
Damage recibed is lower than the posible damage recibed in next round, 
this is giben by (being in atackrange of x unit)

--OVERHAUL DAMAGE
makes the overhaul damage of the enemy lower than mine.
SUM(of damages of pieces in line of sight)

--OVERHAUL HP 
makes the overhaul hp of the enemy lower than mine, considering posible damage. 


-----------MOVEMENT-----------
I should consider when moving 
---Being in atackrange
I should try to avoid getting in atackrange

---Line of sight reduced to my piece positions
I should avoid positions where the line of sight of my units is reduced

---Line of sight reduced to my piece positions
I should try to position myself in positions where the enemy line of sight is reduced
if they move to my position

---Atacks negated by my own pieces.
I should avoid positions where my atack is reduced by my pieces 
For example 
Archer: distance 3 
Warrior distance 1
Archer in position(0,0)
Warrior in position(0,1)
Warrior in position(0,2)
Warrior in position(0,3)
That means i have posible atacks in the x+ direction


Both heuristics should coexist by constants
Each part of Movement and Atacks should also be regulated by constants
